#AiChain contract is a fusion of RFI tokenomics with the added function of auto-liquidity generating protocol. A fork from BEE with some added benefits. First, the dev has minted the tokens - sent the balance to DxSale for fair launch - and then burned the remainder of the tokens. Dev had to participate in the presale. Second, utilized the DxSale protocol to foster trust in the community by auto-locking liquidity for 4 years. Simple tokenomics and elegant design and production of token information have catered to the overall success of the project. 100% community-owned and driven - no rug is possible.
